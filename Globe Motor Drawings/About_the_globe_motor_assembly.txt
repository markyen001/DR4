To Students:
Since this motor is modeled as an assembly, when using it in your CAD model, 
you must use the assembly, facehub, and the motor itself.

The reason that the motor is modeled in this fashion is so that the face hub can rotate
in your model, this will allow you to get a better idea of how the part/assembly you
attach to the motor will move when it is on the motor. 

To take advantage of this, be sure to mate to the face hub when creating your CAD 
model
